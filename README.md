 ## Project Goal
 Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio for CS601! I made this project because it allows me to practice and demonstrate my skills in JavaScript frameworks and also  working with CSS. This project is one of the few that I actually deployed to the live web. I hope you enjoy viewing my small personal site and you could follow this link to it: https://tpy5064.github.io/cs601-project-deployment/
